This file briefly describes the EOS table files found in this directory.

The directory contains the following files:

1) H_TAB_I_EXT.txt			Interpolated hydrogen EOS table, based on the Saumon 95
						EOS tables, extended to 0.98 < log T <  7.06 and 
						-4.4 < log P < 19

2) HE_TAB_I_EXT.txt			Interpolated helium EOS table, based on the Saumon 95
						EOS tables, extended to 0.98 < log T <  7.06 and 
						-4.4 < log P < 19

3) H_HE_TAB_I_30_EXT.txt		EOS table based on files 1) and 2) above for a mixture of 						hydrogen and helium with Y = 0.3

4) EOS_S_H.txt				Interpolated hydrogen EOS table with log T and log S as grid 						parameters

5) EOS_S_H_HE_30.txt			Interpolated EOS table for mixture of hydrogen and helium with Y = 						0.3, with log T and log S as grid parameters 

6) EOS_S_H_HE_30_PRESSURE.txt	Interpolated EOS table for mixture of hydrogen and helium with Y = 						0.3, with log T and log S as grid parameters
