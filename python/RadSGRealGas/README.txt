This folder contains the following scripts:

atmseries.py			Used to generate evolutionary profiles for a series of cores at a fixed distance
atmseries_script.py		Used with 'execfile' to execute atmseries at several distances
cooling.py			Used to calculate cooling terms + cooling time
plot_helper.py		Used to calculate crossover time at fixed distance + critical core mass at various AU. Generally imported in python notebooks

profiles.py			Used to generate evolutionary profiles for a given a and Mc
shoot2.py			Andrew's script for 2D model
shooting.py			Used to generate one static profiles for a given a, Mc and initial atmosphere mass
